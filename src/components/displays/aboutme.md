About Me
========

ðŸ‘‹ Greetings to you!

#### Who Am I?
My name is Shawn. I live in the Greater Houston area in Southeast Texas
with my beautiful wife and three amazing kids. My hobbies and interests
include reading _(mostly non-fiction)_, playing video games _(RPGs and
fighting games baby!)_, writing code, and skateboarding!

#### What Do I Do?
I write code and solve problems. Working almost exclusively with web
technologies, but I love interesting problems in any area of the software
world. Currently a Senior Software Engineer @traclabs where our team
provides mission critical software at a global scale.

Thank you for taking the time to read my short bio. ðŸ˜ƒ
